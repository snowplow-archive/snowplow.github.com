Last night I gave a presentation to the clever folks at Hive London covering three things:

1. How big data technologies like Apache Hive are transforming web analytics
2. Howe we've used Hive in Snowplow development
3. How the role of Hive has changed at Snowplow over time, including a comparison of Hive against other technologies.

The slides from the presentation are below. As always, any questions / comments, please post them below.
