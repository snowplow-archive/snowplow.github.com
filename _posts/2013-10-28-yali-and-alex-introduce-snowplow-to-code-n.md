We were very flattered to be invited by the team at [code_n] [coden] to enter their competition to identify "outstanding young companies and promote their groundbreaking business models". This year's competition is focused on data, and has the motto *Driving the Data Revolution*.

As part of our application process, we put together a short video introducing Snowplow. You can watch the video below.
