I (Alex) will be heading to Tel Aviv next week and then heading on to Nicosia. If you're interested in meeting up to discuss Snowplow, event analytics or big data processing more generally, I'd love to arrange a meeting!

I will be in Tel Aviv all day Sunday March 23rd and Monday March 24th, including speaking at [Big Data & Data Science Israel] [big-data-israel] in Herzeliyya on the Sunday.

I'll then be in Cyprus from March 25th to 28th, predominantly in Nicosia (Lefkosia).

Reach out to me at alex@ (email address on our full domain) to setup a meeting, suggest an event to attend or for anything else Israel- or Cyprus-related!
