I was delighted to speak at the [Big Data & Data Science Israel] [meetup] in Herzliya Pituach last night, giving an introduction to Snowplow as an open source web and event analytics platform.

Huge thanks to Asaf Birenzvieg of [Zaponet: Data Science Solutions] [zaponet] for organizing the meetup, and to Microsoft ILDC for hosting. Asaf and Zaponet are doing a great job building the data meetup community in the Tel Aviv area - I would strongly encourage you to check them out!

The meetup was very rewarding - it was a very technical audience with some prior exposure to Snowplow, which made for a great question and answer session, and some great one-on-one chats afterwards and into today.

My slides from the meetup are after the jump:

It was great making my first trip to Tel Aviv - sad that it was only a flying visit, but I am leaving with a great first impression of the city and the technology community there!

**If you are in the Israeli tech/analytics scene and would like to meet with the Snowplow team, then Yali will be in Israel between April 30 and May 11th and keen to meet - do [get in touch] [talk-to-us]!**
