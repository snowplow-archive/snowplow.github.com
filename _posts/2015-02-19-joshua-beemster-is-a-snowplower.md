You have probably started seeing a new name behind software releases and blog posts recently: we are hugely excited to belatedly introduce Joshua Beemster to the Snowplow team!

![josh-img] [josh-img]

Josh joined us as a Data Engineer last fall. He is our first remote hire - he is currently based in Dijon, France. Josh hails from Australia and is currently taking his Bachelor of Computer Science at Charles Sturt University, Sydney via Distance.

Since starting at Snowplow, Josh has worked on quite a variety of key releases, including:

* The [Snowplow PHP Tracker] [snowplow-php-tracker] versions 0.1.0 and 0.2.0
* The webhook integrations (including MailChimp, PagerDuty and CallRail) released in Snowplow [v0.9.11] [0.9.11] and [v0.9.14] [0.9.14]
* This week's RxJava-based reboot of the [Snowplow Android Tracker] [android-tracker-0.3.0]

Josh has also been busy behind the scenes working on automation and monitoring tools for our [Snowplow Managed Service] [managed-service] customers.

Stay tuned for some very cool tooling around automatic JSON Schema generation that Josh is currently prototyping.

Welcome to the team Josh!
