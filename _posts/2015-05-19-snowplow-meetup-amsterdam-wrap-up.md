Last week Christophe and I headed over to Amsterdam for the first Snowplow meetup in Amsterdam. About 50 data scientists, engineers and analysts joined us at the beautiful [Travelbird] [travelbird] offices to share ideas and approaches to driving value from Snowplow data.

We were very lucky to have three excellent speakers. Niels Reijmer and Andrei Scorus led with a talk about how [de Bijenkorf] [bijenkorf] use Snowplow to collect event-level data to generate more detailed customer-level reporting, understand the results of A/B tests and build a personalization API. It was especially interesting to learn how they were iterating their personalization approach in a data-driven way, layering on additional complexity as they progress. You can view their presentation below.

Ruben Mak from [Blue Mango][bluemango] followered with an indepth look at attribution modeling in a multi-touch world. Ruben covered an enormous amount of ground, starting with an overview of the different approaches available to understand the impact of different channels collectively on driving customer behaviour, before diving into detail into the approach to attribution modeling taken at Blue Mango. You can view his presentation below.

Huge thank you to [Martijn van Vreeden] [martijn] for organising the event, and Rob Winters and the folks at [Travelbird] [travelbird] for hosting us, feeding and watering us :-).

We hope to return to Amsterdam soon for a second event.
