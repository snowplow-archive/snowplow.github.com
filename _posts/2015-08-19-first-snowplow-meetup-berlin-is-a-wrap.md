## Big thanks

Enormous thank you to Sixtine, Christian and Christian for talking at the event, Betahaus for hosting the event and everyone for showing up on what was a beautiful summer's evening in Berlin. Both Christophe and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting everyone at the event and getting a flavour of the Berlin tech and analytics scene. We hope to hold another event in Berlin very shortly.

Especially big thanks to Stephen and the rest of the LeROI team for organizing the event. It's an enormous help having local partners assist organise our meetups around the world and we're grateful for everything the LeROI team did in Berlin to make it happen.
