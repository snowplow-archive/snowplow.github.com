## Breaking news (December 7): first talk title and description announced

In Simon's own words. I cannot wait...

<h3>Snowplow is at the core of everything we do <small>Simon Rumble, Bauer Media</small></h3>

At Bauer Media we started out using Snowplow just because we're data completists and having it all in one place felt right. It now forms the core for a bunch of services that are driving future growth. In this session I'll demo our recommendations, trending and dashboard services and give a bit of insight into how we've rolled behavioural data from 116 sites into one place.
