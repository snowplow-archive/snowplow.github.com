Following on from the [first Snowplow Meetup Amsterdam][last-meetup] last year, we are organising a [second][meetup] for Thursday May 19th.

The event will be held at the [Impact Hub][impact-hub] from 6pm. We'll have pizza, beers, and a two to three speakers. I'll give one talk, giving:

* An overview of Snowplow
* Examples of some of the interesting things our users are doing with their data
* A peak at some of the features we're planning on rolling out this year

The second (and potentially third) talk are still being finalized. If you'd like to talk about how you use Snowplow at your company then [get in touch][contact]. For ideas on topics, check out the write up of the [last meetup][last-meetup]. 

If you'd like to attend, then please [sign up here][meetup]. Finally, if you'd like to meetup with Idan and myself whilst we're in Amsterdam, then [get in touch][contact]. Finally, big thanks to [Martijn van Vreeden][martijn] for his assistance organising the event. Looking forward to being back in the Netherlands!
