It gives us great pleasure to announce another Snowplow meetup in Berlin co-organised with [LeROI][LeROI] set for the 24th May.

![Berlin picture][Berlin-pic]

This is our second visit to Berlin following a [successful meetup][last-meetup] we had back in August.

The event will take place at [Betahaus][Betahaus] (in the cafe) and will kick off at 6:30pm. The talks will start at 7:00pm.

We plan on giving an uber quick intro to Snowplow and [LeROI] and then give the stage to three Snowplow users for 20 minutes each:

1. Christoph Bünte, Engineering Team Lead at [LiveIntent] will give a talk on how they use Snowplow to track intent signals from websites and within emails to generate dynamic, personalised ads.

2. Gino will speak about [NUMBER26] [Number26] analytics journey and how they transitioned to using Snowplow's batch-pipeline (from January) and real-time pipeline (from March) this year.

3. Matthias Warnke, Business Analyst at [Raisin], will speak about how Raisin tracks individual user journeys in great detail for its complete set of customers across a wide set of marketing channels and domains.

If you’d like to attend, then please [sign up here][meetup]. If you would like to meet either Alex or myself whilst we are in Berlin, feel free to [contact] us.

Finally, big thanks to our partners at [LeROI][LeROI] for their assistance in organising the event. Looking forward meeting you all!
