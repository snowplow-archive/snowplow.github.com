Three weeks ago Snowplow users based in New York convened on the TripAdvisor offices for the first [Snowplow Meetup New York][new-york-meetup].

We had four speakers from Snowplow, [Oyster.com][oyster] and [Viewbix][viewbix].

I kicked off the event with a brief overview of the history of Snowplow and a look forward to the key areas of development for the Snowplow platform going forwards.

[Ben Hoyt][ben-linkedin] and Devin Pohl from Oyster.com followed up with a look at the analytics journey they'd been on at Oyster.com, with a particular focus on how they came to using [Looker][looker] and Snowplow from Google Analytics.

Our own [Christophe Bogaert][christophe] followed up with a presentation on data modeling. Christophe has worked closely with the Viewbix team to design and deploy a data modeling process that runs very rapidly (within 10 minutes) on a multi-billion row data set. Christophe described the data modeling process at a high level before diving into the tools and techniques for writing performant data models. You can view his slides below.

It was great to see so many Snowplow users at the event and we look forward to organizing another meetup in the next few months. (Teaser: we're looking forward to a presentation from [DataDog][datadog] on how they uses Snowplow to support their content marketing campaigns!)
