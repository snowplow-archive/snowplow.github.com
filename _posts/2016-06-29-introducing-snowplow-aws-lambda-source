We are pleased to announce the release of [Snowplow AWS Lambda source][lambda-source-repo] - a new event source for Snowplow that allows you to monitor S3 bucket operations using our AWS Lambda function.

<h2 id="s3-bucket-source">1. S3 bucket event source support</h2>

This Snowplow event source allows you to track Amazon S3 bucket operations - keeping a history of any file in a single or many buckets (when it was created, and deleted) through a standard Snowplow-defined event, [com.amazon.aws.lambda/s3_notification_event] [s3-notification-event-schema].

For Snowplow users, this is useful to keep track of where a long-running process is currently if you're using our real-time pipeline, and a way to track the lifecycle of long running bucket operations if you're using our batch pipeline. There are plenty of non-Snowplow use cases too!

<h2 id="architecture">2. Source architecture</h2>

This source is implemented as an [AWS Lambda] [lambda], for two reasons:

1. AWS Lambda functions have easy access to a wide variety of AWS-native event types, including Amazon S3 bucket operations
2. AWS Lambda functions offer low-maintenance horizontal scalability: with the right configuration, this event source can scale to emitting many millions of AWS events into Snowplow

Under the hood, the AWS Lambda source is written in Java 8 and emits each received S3 bucket event to Snowplow as a Snowplow event, using the [Snowplow Java Tracker] [snowplow-java-tracker].

<h2 id="deploy">3. Deployment</h2>

The Snowplow AWS Lambda source download bundle (including deployment scripts) is available on Bintray [here](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/snowplow/snowplow-generic/snowplow_aws_lambda_source_0.1.0_bundle.zip).

There's a [short tutorial here][lambda-source-tut] that explains how to get things up and running. As always for a more complete guide see the [setup guide] [lambda-source-docs] on the Snowplow wiki. This guide explains in more detail how to deploy an AWS Lambda (using provided tooling) that will emit Snowplow events for S3 Put and S3 Delete events. 

<h2 id="roadmap">4. Roadmap for Snowplow AWS Lambda source</h2>

Currently we only support tracking S3 bucket events, but we plan to include support for the [many event sources AWS Lambda permits][lambda-event-sources] over time. If there's a specific event source you are interested in, please [create a ticket] [lambda-source-new-issue]!

<h2 id="contributing">5. Contributing</h2>

The Snowplow AWS Lambda source is open source software! If you'd like us to support a new AWS event type, or just to explore an example of a Java AWS Lambda function - please check out the [repository][lambda-source-repo].
