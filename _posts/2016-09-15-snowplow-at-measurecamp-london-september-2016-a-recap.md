Last Saturday, Christophe, Alex and myself were at [Measurecamp London][measurecamp-london].

It has been great watching Measurecamp grow from humble roots in with the first London event 4 years ago to something that really is a global phenomenon. In that time a real digital analytics community has formed and spread: there are events all over the world. It's been great seeing the level of discussion and analytic sophistication rise event-on-event.

We built Snowplow because we're passionate about digital analytics and empowering digital analysts. It is great to be in a position where we can sponsor Measurecamp.

I gave a talk at the event on Snowplow itself: how we're trying to change the way that people do digital analytics. You can view my slides below.

Christophe led a very interesting discussion on event data modeling, attended by people working with event stream data using Snowplow, the Adobe `hits.tsv` data and homegrown analytics stacks. He explored some of the challenges consuming and analysing digital event data, and outlined a number of strategies that he's developed.

Alex gave a talk on using data to build data-driven products. In his own words:

> The challenge for analysts has moved on from deriving insights, to turning our insights into actions. It's no longer enough just to understand which of your customers have a high propensity to churn - what can you *do* about it, ideally in near-real-time? In this session at MeasureCamp London I introduced the rationale for building “measure-driven products”, before diving into a live coding demo using Snowplow, Google Tag Manager and Pusher and some simple JavaScript to power per-customer in-session messaging on a website.

A number of our team will be at the first [Measurecamp Berlin][measurecamp-berlin] in October. Let us know if you'd like to grab coffee whilst we're in Berlin.

Big thanks to the Measurecamp organisations for another fantastic event.
