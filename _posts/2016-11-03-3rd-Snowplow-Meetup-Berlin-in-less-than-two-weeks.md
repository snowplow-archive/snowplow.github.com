We have linedup some fantastic speakers:

1. Dominik Raute and Christoph Hoyer from [JustWatch] will talk about how the raw data capabilities of Snowplow enabled the audience segmentation infrastructure that power the JustWatch campaign business - and how the approach of universal data capture, together with an audience-centric way of interfacing with their users created a whole new paradigm to their growth and business intelligence teams. They'll dive into the technical details of why and how we built the JustWatch Audience Builder with components both on top of and on the side of Snowplow, share our learnings with the framework and talk about best practices we picked up on the way.


2. [Alex Dean][alex], our co-founder will be talking about Sauna our exciting new open-source product designed to make it easy for business analysts to turn insights they derive from their event streams into actions.
If Snowplow makes it easier for data analysts to build intelligence on their data, Sauna is here to make it easy for them to action that intelligence, by feeding it back into the different channels that are used to manage customer engagement.

3. Franz Posch, co-founder at [Incuda][incuda], will explain how they use Snowplow data to build an integrated, journey-based view of user interaction to drive both marketing / customer analytics and product analytics. Franz will describe their approach to user-journey modeling, which takes into account multi-channel and multi-device interaction and can be used for predictive analytics and attribution, amongst other things.

It going to be super interesting, [sign up today][berlin-meetup]!
