If you wonder where the Snowplow team will be in the next few months, here is a list of upcoming events, which we are excited to announce.

## Snowplow Meetup London number 4
Our [London Snowplow Meetup #4](https://www.meetup.com/Snowplow-Analytics-London/events/236758110/) will take place at 6.30 pm on February the 8th, at [CodeNode](https://skillsmatter.com/event-space).

In addition to a talk from one of the Snowplow team, we have two fantastic speakers lined up:

1.	Dejan Petelin, senior data scientist at [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk/), will be talking about various use cases of Snowplow and why they are moving to the real-time pipeline. Gousto is a British online retailer, headquartered in London, that delivers recipe kit boxes, which include fresh, delicious and nutritional ingredients and step-by-step, chef-designed recipes.
2.	Bruce Pannaman, data scientist at [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/en/about), will be speaking about how you can expand the usage of your data from the end of your Snowplow pipeline. Busuu is the world’s largest social network for language learning, providing courses in 12 different languages on web and mobile to more than 60 million learners worldwide.
