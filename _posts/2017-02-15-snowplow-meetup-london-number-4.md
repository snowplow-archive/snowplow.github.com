<h2 id="gousto">How Gousto is moving to the real-time pipeline to enable just-in-time personalization</h2>

Dejan Petelin, head of data science at [Gousto](https://www.gousto.co.uk/), gave a presentation about their data journey, explaining how data reflects the customer’s voice and the importance of joining up all data sources. The goal is to delight and retain customers – critical for a subscription business like Gousto’s. Gousto is using Snowplow as a unified log, to scale up its data capabilities, listen to its customers and provide them with a more personalized experience. Finally, Gousto is moving to the real-time pipeline to enable just-in-time personalization.

<h2 id="busuu">Why Snowplow is at the heart of Busuu's data and analytics infrastructure</h2>

Bruce Pannaman, data scientist at [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/en/about), talked about why they are using Snowplow to validate and enrich data, enable one source of truth across different data sources, cope with peaks and troughs in the data stream, and easily integrate with third party systems such as Intercom, a customer messaging platform. One of Busuu’s future projects is to load multiple A/B tests into the apps and monitor their results in real time.

<h2 id="snowplow">Evolving your analytics stack with your business</h2>

Christophe Bogaert, Data Scientist at Snowplow, talked about how businesses are constantly evolving, why that means their analytics stack needs to evolve with it and how Snowplow supports that evolution. With Snowplow, you can flexibly define the events and entities to represent your business. Finally, he talked about event data modeling and how to handle the evolution of your data pipeline.
