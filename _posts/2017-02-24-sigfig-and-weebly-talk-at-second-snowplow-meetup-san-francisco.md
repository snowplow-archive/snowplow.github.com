Last night we were delighted to host our second [Snowplow Meetup San Francisco][sf-meetup], at the lovely Looker offices.

The event kicked off with a talk from [Sigfig's][sigfig] [Benny Wijatno][benny] and [Jenna Lemonias][jenna]. Benny and Jenna gave an overview of Sigfig, before exploring how they use Snowplow to answer a wide variety of questions related to customer acquisition.

[Weebly's][weebly] [Audrey Carstensen][audrey] and Bo Han followed up with an overview of how Snowplow is deployed at Weebly, before diving into a tonne of detail on how Weebly build funnel analyses in Looker on top of their Snowplow data.

Lastly, I gave a talk on how event data pipelines need to evolve with businesses as they evolve, and how self-describing data and event data modeling are the key ingredients that ensure that the Snowplow pipelines can evolve gracefully over time.
