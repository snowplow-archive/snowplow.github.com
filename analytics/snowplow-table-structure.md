# SnowPlow table structure

SnowPlow data is stored in a single Apache Hive table. Each line in the table represents a single event, be that a page view, add-to-basket, video play etc.

The table structures for SnowPlow data in Hive and Infobright are almost identical. We'll cover the structure of the [Hive table](#hive-table-definition) before looking at the [Infobright table definition](#infobright) to see how it differs.

## Hive table definitions

Understanding the SnowPlow table structure(s) in Hive is a pre-requisite to being able to write your own HiveQL queries.


The Hive table generated by **SnowPlowEventDeserializer** to hold SnowPlow-logged page views and events looks like this:

| **FIELD**            | **DATATYPE**   | **CAN BE EMPTY?** | **DESCRIPTION**            |
|:---------------------|:---------------|:------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Date/time**        |                |                   | _The date and time of this page view or event_ |
| `dt`                 | STRING         | No                | Date                       |
| `tm`                 | STRING         | No                | Time                       |
| **Transaction**      |                |                   | _Identifying this logging event_ |
| `txn_id`             | STRING         | No                | A unique event ID. If two or more records have the same txn_id, one is a duplicate record |
| **User and visit**   |                |                   | _Identifying the web user and this specific visit_ |
| `user_id`            | STRING         | No                | A unique ID assigned to each browser and stored on the SnowPlow cookie. |
| `user_ipaddress`     | STRING         | No                | Visitor IP Address         |
| `visit_id`           | INT            | No                | A counter that indicates what visit this is for this particular user_id i.e. 1 if this is a user's first visit, 2 if it is his / her 2nd visit |
| **Page**             |                |                   | _Identifying the web page being visited_ |
| `page_url`           | STRING         | No                | The web page URL           |
| `page_title`         | STRING         | Yes               | The web page title         |
| `page_referrer`      | STRING         | No                | The referrer URL. If this is the first page view of a session, it points at the referrering website / search engine if applicable |
| **Marketing**        |                |                   | _Marketing campaign attribution_ |
| `mkt_medium`         | STRING         | Yes               | The type of ad used e.g. cpc, banner, email, affiliate... |
| `mkt_source`         | STRING         | Yes               | The source of the ad: used e.g. Google, MSN, Facebook, TradeDoubler |
| `mkt_term`           | STRING         | Yes               | Any keywords associated with the ad. This is relevant for search ads |
| `mkt_content`        | STRING         | Yes               | The content of the ad, or a reference to the creative ID. Used e.g. to compare the results within a campaign between different creatives. |
| `mkt_campaign`       | STRING         | Yes               | The campaign name. A single campaign may involve ads on multiple sources / mediums, so `mkt_campaign` is often a way of grouping them together into a single marketing initiative |
| **Event**            |                |                   | _If this is an event being logged, its details_ |

| `ev_property`        | STRING         | Yes               | A property associated with the event / action. This might be the number of seconds into a video play starts, or the quantity of an item added to basket |
| `ev_value`           | STRING         | Yes               | A value associated with with the action e.g. the value of the items added to basket |

## Infobright table definitions

The Infobright table definition is very similar to the Hive table definition. Two differences are worth noting:

1. The data types for a number of fields are different. Hive is very good at casting e.g. STRINGs as FLOATs implicitly where possibly and explicitly where required at query time. Infobright is less good, so some of the fields that are set to STRING in Hive (e.g. ev_value) are set to numeric types in Infobright.
2. Infobright does not support the ARRAY data type used for the `br_features` field. Rather than pack all the different browser features in a single array, then, a separate column is used to store each possible browser feature.

The Infobright table looks like this:

| **FIELD**                | **DATATYPE**  |
|:-------------------------|:--------------|
| dt                       | date          |
