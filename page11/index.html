			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/05/14/snowplow-0.8.3-released-with-unstructured-events">Snowplow 0.8.3 released with unstructured events</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the release of Snowplow <strong>0.8.3</strong>. This release updates our JavaScript Tracker to version 0.11.2, adding the ability to send custom unstructured events to a Snowplow collector with <code>trackUnstructEvent()</code>. The Clojure Collector is also bumped to 0.5.0, to include some important bug fixes.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that this release only adds unstructured events to the JavaScript Tracker - adding unstructured events to our Enrichment process and storage targets is on the roadmap - but rest assured we are working on it!</strong></p>

<p>Many thanks to community members <a href='https://github.com/rgabo'>Gabor Ratky</a>, <a href='https://github.com/tarsolya'>Andras Tarsoly</a> and <a href='https://github.com/lackac'>Laszlo Bacsi</a>, all from <a href='http://secretsaucepartners.com/'>Secret Sauce Partners</a>, for contributing this great feature: Gabor and his team took JavaScript unstructured events from an item on our roadmap to a code-complete feature, big thanks guys! (And if you are interested in seeing how the design and implementation of this powerful feature evolved, do have a read of the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/pull/198'>original GitHub pull request</a>.)</p>

			<img src='/static/img/blog/2013/05/lone-traveller.jpg' />
<p>Web analysts spend a lot of time exploring where visitors to their websites come from:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which sites and marketing campaigns are driving visitors to your website?</li>

<li>How valuable are those visitors?</li>

<li>What should you be doing to drive up the number of high quality users? (In terms of spending more marketing, engaging with other websites / blogs / social networks etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, identifying where your visitors come from is <strong>not</strong> as straightforward as it often seems. In this post, we will cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/05/10/where-does-your-traffic-really-come-from/#how'>How, technically, can we determine where visitors have come from?</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/05/10/where-does-your-traffic-really-come-from#errors'>Potential sources of errors</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/05/10/where-does-your-traffic-really-come-from#ga'>Problems with relying on the Google Analytics approach, and why the Snowplow approach is superior</a></li>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/05/08/snowplow-0.8.2-released-with-clojure-collector-enhancements">Snowplow 0.8.2 released with Clojure Collector enhancements</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We&#8217;re pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow <strong>0.8.2</strong>. This release updates the Clojure Collector only; if you are using the CloudFront Collector, then no upgrade to 0.8.2 is necessary.</p>

<p>Many thanks to community member <a href='https://github.com/butlermh'>Mark H. Butler</a> for his major contributions to this release - much appreciated Mark!</p>

<p>This release bumps the Clojure Collector to version <strong>0.4.0</strong>. There are three main changes to the Collector:</p>

<ol>
<li>Building the Collector&#8217;s warfile is now much simpler, thanks to a new <code>lein aws</code> command contributed by Mark</li>

<li>We have fixed a bug (<a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/220'>#220</a>) where occasionally the Collector&#8217;s event logging would log <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (empty string) rather than <code>&quot;-&quot;</code> for a missing referer. While rare, when this occurred this would cause the Snowplow ETL process to break (requiring manual editing of the offending log file)</li>

<li>Some code tidy-up, including making the Clojure Collector work with newer versions of Leiningen</li>
</ol>

<p>To upgrade to this release:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the new warfile by right-clicking on <a href='http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/snowplow-hosted-assets/2-collectors/clojure-collector/clojure-collector-0.4.0-standalone.war'>this link</a> and selecting &#8220;Save As&#8230;&#8221;</li>

<li>Log in to your Amazon Elastic Beanstalk console</li>

<li>Browse to your Collector&#8217;s application</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;Upload New Version&#8221; and upload your warfile</li>
</ol>

<p>And that should be it. Thanks again to Mark for his contribution to this release - and we&#8217;re excited to have some further community contributions coming very soon to Snowplow, so watch this space!</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/04/23/performing-funnel-analysis-with-snowplow">Funnel analysis with Snowplow (Platform analytics part 1)</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p><a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>Eleven days ago</a>, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a set of recipes covering how to measure the performance of <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>content pages</a> and <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>product pages</a>.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;ve published the first set of recipes in the new <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/overview.html'>platform analytics</a> section of the Cookbook. By &#8216;platform analytics&#8217;, we mean analytics performed to answer questions about how your platform (or &#8216;website&#8217;, &#8216;application&#8217; or &#8216;product&#8217;) performs. This is one of the most important branches of analytics that can be performed with clickstream, event data.</p>

<p>The first recipes published cover how to perform <a href='/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis.html'>funnel analysis</a> with Snowplow, like the example below, that compares the purchase funnel for an online shop by month.</p>

<p><img alt='funnel-analysis' src='/static/img/analytics/platform-analytics/funnel-analysis/visualization-in-tableau.jpg' /></p>

<p>Funnel analysis is an important example of platform analytics. Snowplow makes it straightforward to define and analyse funnels on the fly: unlike Google Analytics, you do not have to predefine funnels in advance, then collect data, before you can analyse how users progress through them. This is important as it makes it possible to spot e.g. that your visitors are using your platform in a particular (perhaps unexpected) way, and then immediately drill into how many exactly, are doing so, and at what point in that workflow do different users &#8216;drop out&#8217; of the funnel.</p>

<p>In addition, Snowplow also makes it easy to compare multiple funnels (e.g. like the time series example above, or, instead, comparing how successfully different audience segments progress through different funnels).</p>

<p>This will be the first of many platform analytics recipes - if there are specific analyses you&#8217;d like us to cover, or would like to contribute yourself, then let us know below or by <a href='/about/index.html'>getting in touch</a> directly.</p>

			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p><em>This is the second part in our blog post series on Catalog Analytics. The <a href='/blog/2013/04/12/online-catalog-analytics-with-snowplow/'>first part</a> was published last week.</em></p>

<p>Last week, we started building out the <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/overview.html'>Catalog Analytics</a> section of the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a>, with a section documenting how to <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-product-page-performance.html'>measure the effectiveness of your product pages</a>. Those recipes were geared specifically towards retailers.</p>

<p>This week, we&#8217;ve added an extra section to the cookbook, covering <a href='/analytics/catalog-analytics/measuring-and-comparing-content-page-performance.html'>how to measure engagement levels with content pages</a>. The recipes covered should be of interest to any company that produces content-rich web pages. (Indeed, all the example analytics were performed using data from this very website.) However, they should be of special interest to publishers and newspaper sites that depend on driving high levels of user engagement with content to make money</p>

<p>In the new section, we cover a range of recipes, including comparing web pages by what fraction of them is read, on average, by visitors to those pages:</p>
