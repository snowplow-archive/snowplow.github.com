			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/12/snowplow-0.6.0-released-with-storage-loader">SnowPlow 0.6.0 released, with the new StorageLoader</a></h1>
			<p>We&#8217;re very pleased to start the week by releasing a new version of SnowPlow - version <strong>0.6.0</strong>. This is a big release for us - as it includes the first version of our all-new StorageLoader. The release also includes a small set of tweaks and bug fixes across the existing SnowPlow components, but let&#8217;s start by introducing StorageLoader:</p>

<h2 id='introducing_storageloader'>Introducing StorageLoader</h2>

<p>Up until now, SnowPlow has stored all its data in S3, where it can be queried in Hive. However, our vision with SnowPlow has always been to enable to the broadest set of analyses on SnowPlow data as possible. That means making it as easy as possible to keep up to date versions of SnowPlow data in many different types of database. The StorageLoader is a key component to fulfilling that vision.</p>

<p><img src='/static/img/SnowPlowLoader.jpg' alt='snowplow-loader-image' /></p>

<p>StorageLoader is a Ruby application that downloads SnowPlow event files from S3 and loads them into an alternative database. It has been built to make keeping an up to date version of your SnowPlow data in other databases as easy as possible. Currently, it only supports loading the data into <a href='http://www.infobright.org/'>Infobright Community Edition (ICE)</a> - a high-performance columnar database based on MySQL. However, we plan to extend it over the next few months to support a range of other databases including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='https://developers.google.com/bigquery'>Google Big Query</a> for fast analysis of massive data sets. (This could be very powerful for rapid analytics across SnowPlow&#8217;s granular data)</li>

<li><a href='http://skydb.io'>SkyDB</a> for event path analysis and other, broader types of event stream analytics</li>

<li><a href='http://www.postgresql.org'>PostgreSQL</a> for web analytics for web properties where the levels of traffic are not Facebook-scale</li>
</ul>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/06/snowplow-0.5.2-released-and-introducing-sluice">SnowPlow 0.5.2 released, and introducing the Sluice Ruby gem</a></h1>
			<p>Another week, another release: SnowPlow <strong>0.5.2</strong>! This is a small release, consisting just of a small set of bug fixes and improvements to EmrEtlRunner - although we&#8217;ll also use this post to introduce our new Ruby gem, called Sluice.</p>

<p>Many thanks to community member <a href='https://github.com/testower'>Tom Erik Støwer</a> for his testing of EmrEtlRunner over the weekend, which helped us to identify and fix these bugs:</p>

<h2 id='bugs_fixed'>Bugs fixed</h2>

<p><strong><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/71'>Issue 71</a></strong>: the template <code>config.yml</code> (in the GitHub repo and in the wiki) was specifying an out-of-date version for the Hive deserializer. We have updated this to specify version <strong>0.5.0</strong> of the serde, like so:</p>

<pre><code>...
:snowplow:
  :serde_version: 0.4.9
...</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues/72'>Issue 72</a></strong>: Tom&#8217;s testing also identified a bug in EmrEtlRunner&#8217;s log archiving, which only occurs if the Processing Bucket contains sub-folders. This has now been fixed too.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/01/snowplow-0.5.1-released">SnowPlow 0.5.1 released, with lots of small improvements</a></h1>
			<p>We have just released SnowPlow <strong>0.5.1</strong>! Rather than one large new feature, version 0.5.1 is an incremental release which contains lots of small fixes and improvements to the ETL and storage sub-systems. The two big themes of these updates are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Improving the robustness of the ETL process</li>

<li>Laying the foundations for loading SnowPlow events into <a href='http://www.infobright.org/'>Infobright Community Edition</a> (ICE)</li>
</ol>

<p>To take each of these themes in turn:</p>

<h2 id='1_a_more_robust_etl_process'>1. A more robust ETL process</h2>

<p>The Hive deserializer now has improved error handling - many thanks to community member <a href='https://github.com/mtibben'>Michael Tibben</a> from <a href='http://99designs.com'>99designs</a> for his help here!</p>

<p>Firstly, the Hive deserializer is now setup to log warnings (rather than die) on non-critical data quality issues.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is now an option (switched off by default) to continue processing even on unexpected row-level errors (such as an input file not matching the expected CloudFront format). We have added a configuration option to the EmrEtlRunner&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/blob/master/3-etl/emr-etl-runner/config/config.yml'>configuration file</a> to support this:</p>

<pre><code>:etl:
  :continue_on_unexpected_error: false</code></pre>

		<a name="New version of GA - what it means for SnowPlow adoption" />
		<div class="post">
			31 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-google-analytics-means-for-companies-adopting-snowplow">SnowPlow in a Universal Analytics world - what the new version of Google Analytics means for companies adopting SnowPlow</a></h1>
			<p>Earlier this week, Google announced a series of significant advances in Google Analytics at the GA Summit, that are collectively referred to as <a href='http://cutroni.com/blog/2012/10/29/universal-analytics-the-next-generation-of-google-analytics/'>Universal Analytics</a>. In this post, we look at:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='#what'>The actual features Google has announced</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-proposition-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-ga-means-for-snowplow-adoption#whysnowplow'>How those advances change the case for companies considering adopting SnowPlow</a></li>
</ol>

<p><img src='/static/img/google-analytics-universal-analytics.png' alt='universal-analytics-image' /></p>
<a name='what' />
<h2 id='1_what_changes_has_google_announced'>1. What changes has Google announced?</h2>

<p>The most significant change Google has announced is the new <a href='https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/'>Measurement Protocol</a>, which enables businesses using GA to capture much more data. This will make it possible for Google to deliver a much broader range of reports, of higher business value, than was previously possible. To understand the changes, we start by considering what <a href='#new-data-points'>new data points</a> businesses can <em>feed</em> GA, before considering <a href='/blog/2012/10/31/snowplow-proposition-in-a-universal-analytics-world-what-the-new-version-of-ga-means-for-snowplow-adoption#reporting-capabilities'>what that means for GA&#8217;s reporting capabilities</a>.</p>
<a name='new-data-points' />
<h3 id='11_custom_user_identifiers'>1.1 Custom user identifiers</h3>

<p>The first new data points that businesses can feed into Google Analytics is a user&#8217;s <code>client_id</code> (basically, a customer ID) as defined on the business&#8217;s own systems.</p>

<p>Previously, Google Analytics identified unique users using their own <code>cookie_id</code>s. Google&#8217;s <code>cookie_id</code>s are an excellent starting point for identifying users, because so many users have Google accounts (thanks to their myriad mass-market services, including Gmail, YouTube, Google Play etc): consumers using these services on multiple devices identify themselves to Google when they login, meaning that Google can marry their <code>cookie_id</code>s for these users on all the different devices they use. Our assumption is that Google already use this to reliably identify individual users across multiple platforms and devices.</p>

<p>For businesses using GA, being able to augment Google&#8217;s user identification with their own internal <code>client_id</code>s is a significant step forwards for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many GA users (especially those with applications or properties where users login, or those with a loyalty card scheme) can identify their own users reliably on specific platforms, devices and physical stores. By adding this additional user identification data into GA, GA will be more accurate at identifying the same user in different places reliably, moving us further from a world in which we rely on persistent cookies dropped on browsers with unique identifiers, to one where users are more robustly identified via logins, payments and loyalty schemes. These approaches will still use cookies, but as part of a broader set of user identification business processes that actively involve the user in the identification process</li>

<li>It should make it easier for GA users to join GA data with other customer data sets on those <code>client_id</code>s. This is more of a nuanced point, as it was still possible previously to add customer IDs to GA as custom variables and use that to do joining</li>
</ol>

		<a name="SnowPlow 0.5.0 released with EmrEtlRunner" />
		<div class="post">
			25 Oct 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/25/snowplow-0.5.0-released">SnowPlow 0.5.0 released, now with a Ruby gem to run SnowPlow's ETL process on Amazon EMR</a></h1>
			<p>We have just released SnowPlow <strong>0.5.0</strong>, with an all-new component, the SnowPlow EmrEtlRunner. EmrEtlRunner is a Ruby application to run SnowPlow&#8217;s Hive-based ETL (extract, transform, load) process on <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/'>Amazon Elastic MapReduce</a> with minimum fuss.</p>

<p>We are hugely grateful to community member <a href='https://github.com/mtibben'>Michael Tibben</a> from <a href='http://99designs.com'>99designs</a> for his contributions to EmrEtlRunner: thanks to Michael, EmrEtlRunner is more efficient, more flexible and more robust than it otherwise would have been - and ready sooner. Many thanks Michael!</p>

<h2 id='using_emretlrunner'>Using EmrEtlRunner</h2>

<p>EmrEtlRunner is a Ruby application which you can setup on your server to regularly take your raw SnowPlow logs (as stored in CloudFront access logs) and apply the Hive-based ETL process to them using <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/'>Amazon Elastic MapReduce</a>. This ETL process populates a Hive-format events table which you can then use with the HiveQL recipes in our <a href='http://snowplowanalytics.com/analytics/index.html'>Analyst&#8217;s Cookbook</a>.</p>

<p>For detailed instructions on installing, running and scheduling EmrEtlRunner on your server, please see the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Deploying-EmrEtlRunner'>Deploying EmrEtlRunner</a> guide on the SnowPlow Analytics wiki.</p>
