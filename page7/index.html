			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/06/26/getting-started-with-r-for-data-analysis-and-visualization">Getting started using R for data analysis</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p><a href='http://cran.r-project.org/'>R</a> is one of the most popular data analytics tools out there, with a rich and vibrant community of users and contributors. In spite of its popularity in general (and particularly with amongst academics and statisticians), R is not a common tool to find in business or web analysts arsenal, where Excel and Google Analytics tend to reign supreme.</p>

<p><img alt='img1' src='/static/img/analytics/tools/r/boxplot.png' /></p>

<p>That is a real shame. R is a fantastic tool for exploring data, reworking it, visualizing it, developing models, and then comparing those models against your data sets. My work crunching data has become immeasurably easier and more pleasurable since I learnt R: I spend less time cleaning and organising data, and performing other boring things like formatting visualizations and checking for errors. I spend much more time actually mining data, deriving insights, testing and building on those insights.</p>

<p>Given how great it is, why is R used so little by business and web analysts? I think there are two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>People are put off by the command-line. The learning curve for command-line tools in general is steep initially. In addition, there are some quirks to the R language and syntax that make it puzzling for newbies who are familiar with other command-line tools for data analysis e.g. Python.</li>

<li>Most business and web analysts spend more time describing data that actually deriving insights from it. For descriptive work, tools like Excel and BI / OLAP tools like Tableau are OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to encourage business and web analysts get started with R, we&#8217;ve put together <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/get-started-analysing-snowplow-data-with-r.html'>a tutorial</a> in the <a href='/analytics/index.html'>Analytics Cookbook</a> geared specifically towards newbies who want to start playing with R. The purpose is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get started quickly, by working with real web analytics data from Snowplow</li>

<li>Get started with visualizations, to make the data come alive</li>

<li>Cover the basics of concepts like factors and data frames, which are core to the way R works</li>

<li>Give enough of an overview with the example that someone who works through the tutorial can then go off and productively use the multitude of other resources out there to build their knowledge of R.</li>
</ol>

<p>The recipe - <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/get-started-analysing-snowplow-data-with-r.html'>Getting Started with R</a>, is available <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/get-started-analysing-snowplow-data-with-r.html'>here</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/06/05/tracking-olark-chat-events-with-snowplow">Tracking Olark chat events with Snowplow</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p>As some of you will have noticed, we recently installed <a href='http://www.olark.com/'>Olark</a> on the Snowplow website. Olark powers the chat box you see on the bottom right of the screen: if you click on it, and if one of the Snowplow team is at their desks, you can talk directly to us.</p>

<p><img alt='olark-logo' src='/static/img/blog/2013/06/olark/olark-logo.png' /></p>

<p>Setting up Olark was an incredibly easy process - the Olark team provides a very straightforward <a href='http://www.olark.com/customer/portal/articles/337453-getting-started-guide'>quick start guide</a>. We tested Olark for a week on the Snowplow website - we wanted to see:</p>

<ol>
<li>Whether people visiting the site would want to chat to us.</li>

<li>Whether the chats were &#8220;useful&#8221; i.e. did they drive visitors to become Snowplow users? Did they help us identify content on the site that was confusing and needed clarification? Does it help drive sales of <a href='http://snowplowanalytics.com/services/index.html'>Snowplow professional services</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>What became clear very quickly was that only a minority of visitors to the Snowplow site were interested in chatting. However, the &#8220;usefulness&#8221; of those chats was very high - already two professional services contracts have been won off the back of initial conversations powered by Olark. And in addition, we learnt a lot about where out content needs clarifying.</p>

<p>The testing of Olark to date has been qualitative however. Longer term, we want to assess the value Olark adds quantitatively. To do this, naturally, we turn to Snowplow. We want to track Olark chat events in Snowplow, so that we can then analyze the Snowplow data to understand:</p>

<ol>
<li>The type of user behavior on the site that typically leads up to a user reaching out to us on Olark</li>

<li>The type of user behavior on the site that leads to a user being responsive to us reaching out to them via Olark</li>

<li>What impact do conversation on Olark have on the visitors subsequent browsing behavior (and likelihood to start using Snowplow and buying Snowplow professional services)?</li>

<li>How good (quick) we are at responding to visitors reaching out to us via Olark?</li>
</ol>

<p>In this blog post, we will describe how we used <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/2-Specific-event-tracking-with-the-Javascript-tracker#wiki-custom-structured-events'>Snowplow structured events</a> to track Olark chat events. In a future blog post, we will analyze the data collected in Snowplow, to show how to answer the four questions outlined above. (We&#8217;ll write this once we&#8217;ve been running Olark for a while, so have a good data set to use to peform the analysis.)</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/06/03/snowplow-0.8.6-released-with-performance-improvements">Snowplow 0.8.6 released with performance improvements</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We are very pleased to announce the release of Snowplow <strong>0.8.6</strong>, with two significant performance-related improvements to the Hadoop ETL. These improvements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Hadoop ETL process is now much faster at processing raw Snowplow log files generated by the CloudFront Collector, because we have <a href='http://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2013/05/30/dealing-with-hadoops-small-files-problem/'>tackled the Hadoop &#8220;small files problem&#8221;</a></li>

<li>You can now configure your ETL process on Elastic MapReduce to use Task instances alongside your Master and Core instances; optionally these task instances can be spot (bid-based) instances rather than on-demand</li>
</ol>

<p>In this post, then, we will cover:</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/05/30/dealing-with-hadoops-small-files-problem">Dealing with Hadoop's small files problem</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>Hadoop has a serious Small File Problem. It&#8217;s widely known that Hadoop struggles to run MapReduce jobs that involve thousands of small files: Hadoop much prefers to crunch through tens or hundreds of files sized at or around the magic 128 megabytes. The technical reasons for this are well explained in this <a href='http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2009/02/the-small-files-problem/'>Cloudera blog post</a> - what is less well understood is how badly small files can slow down your Hadoop job, and what to do about it.</p>
<img src='/static/img/blog/2013/05/plowing-small-files.jpg' />
<p>In this blog post we will discuss the small files problem in terms of our experiences with it at Snowplow. <strong>And we will argue that dealing with the small files problem - if you have it - is the single most important optimisation you can perform on your MapReduce process.</strong></p>

			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of Snowplow <strong>0.8.5</strong>. This is a bug fixing release, following on from our launch last week of Snowplow 0.8.4 with geo-IP lookups.</p>

<p>This release fixes one showstopper issue with Snowplow 0.8.4, and also includes a set of smaller enhancements to help the Scalding ETL better handle &#8220;bad quality&#8221; event data from webpages. We recommend everybody on the Snowplow 0.8.x series upgrade to this version.</p>

<p>Many thanks to community members <a href='https://github.com/petervanwesep'>Peter van Wesep</a> and <a href='https://github.com/rgabo'>Gabor Ratky</a> for their help identifying and debugging the issues fixed in this release!</p>
