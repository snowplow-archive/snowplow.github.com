			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/22/snowplow-0.7.1-released">Snowplow 0.7.1 released, with easier-to-run Ruby apps</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We&#8217;re happy to announce the release of Snowplow version <strong>0.7.1</strong>. This release is designed to make it much easier to install and run the two Snowplow Ruby applications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/3-etl/emr-etl-runner'>EmrEtlRunner</a> - which runs the Snowplow ETL job</li>

<li><a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/4-storage/storage-loader'>StorageLoader</a> - which loads Snowplow events into Infobright</li>
</ol>

<p>From the feedback we received, setting up and running these two Ruby apps was the most challenging (and error-prone) part of the Snowplow experience. Many thanks to all of those in the community who reported bugs with our original approach and suggested fixes!</p>

<p>To streamline this process and reduce the chances of problems occurring, we have updated both Ruby apps to work in a <a href='https://rvm.io/integration/bundler/'>RVM+Bundler</a> environment, inline with Ruby community best practice. Specifically, we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Created a simple <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Ruby-and-RVM-setup'>guide to setting up Ruby and RVM</a> ready for Snowplow</li>

<li>Updated both of our Ruby apps to use RVM and Bundler</li>

<li>Updated our cronjob shell scripts to work with RVM and Bundler</li>

<li>Updated the setup guides (<a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/EmrEtlRunner-setup'>EmrEtlRunner</a>; <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/StorageLoader-setup'>StorageLoader</a>) for both apps to follow RVM and Bundler best practice</li>
</ul>

<p>This release bumps EmrEtlRunner to version 0.0.8 and StorageLoader to version 0.0.4.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! Hopefully this release fixes all of the Ruby-related issues encountered by Snowplow users - but of course there might still be a couple of teething issues. If you spot anything that still doesn&#8217;t seem right, do please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/21/working-out-what-data-to-pass-into-your-tag-manager">What data should you be passing into your tag manager?</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p>Since the launch of <a href='https://www.google.com/tagmanager/'>Google Tag Manager</a>, a plethora of blog posts have been written on the value of tag management solutions. What has been left out of the discussion is practical advice on how to setup your tag management solution (be it <a href='https://www.google.com/tagmanager/'>GTM</a> or <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>OpenTag</a> or one of the paid solutions), and, crucially, what data you should be passing into your tag manager. In this post, we will outline a methodology for identifying all the relevant data you should be passing in, and bringing that methodology to life with a real-world example.</p>
<img src='/static/img/tag-management/tag-management-schematic.gif' width='320' />
<h2 id='why_is_it_important_to_define_at_implementation_time_what_data_to_pass_to_your_tag_manager'>Why is it important to define, at implementation time, what data to pass to your tag manager?</h2>

<p>One of the things we hear a lot from proponents of tag management (especially from web analyts) is that they make it easy to capture data from web pages. Indeed, the <em>best</em> solutions enable analysts with no development knowledge to identify and capture new data points, to pass onto their web analytics program, without any programming knowledge, using snazzy drag-and-drop UIs.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/20/snowplow-hits-202-stars">Snowplow reaches 202 stars on GitHub</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>As of this weekend, the Snowplow repository on GitHub now has over 200 stars! We&#8217;re hugely excited to reach this milestone - this makes us:</p>

<ul>
<li>The 3rd most-watched analytics project on GitHub, after <a href='https://github.com/mnutt/hummingbird'>Hummingbird</a> (real-time analytics) and <a href='https://github.com/Countly/countly-server'>Countly</a> (mobile analytics)</li>

<li>The <a href='https://github.com/languages/Scala/most_watched?page=3'>58th most-watched</a> Scala project on GitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to everyone in the Snowplow community and on GitHub for their support and interest!</p>

<p>We thought it might be interesting to share the <a href='http://jrvis.com/red-dwarf/?user=snowplow&amp;repo=snowplow'>Red Dwarf heatmap</a> of where our 202 GitHub stars are located across the world:</p>

<p><img alt='heatmap' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/snowplow-stars-at-202.png' /></p>

<p>Beyond the &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the US and Europe, it&#8217;s encouraging to see growing interest in Snowplow from South America, South/East Asia and Australia/New Zealand. We look forward to checking back on the heatmap when we have some more stars!</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/18/using-snowplow-with-qubit-opentag">Implementing Snowplow with QuBit's OpenTag</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/yali.html" rel="author">Yali Sassoon </a></span>
			<p>This is a short blog post to highlight a new section on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Snowplow-setup-guide'>Snowplow setup guide</a> covering <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate Snowplow with QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag tag management system</a>.</p>

<p>In November last year, we started playing with tag management systems: testing Snowplow with Google Tag Manager, and documented how to setup Snowplow with GTM on the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating-javascript-tags-with-Google-Tag-Manager'>Snowplow setup guide</a>. We were impressed on a number of fronts, but thought that the much more thought need to be put into what data was passed into the tag management system than people typically admit. (We documented our thoughts, at the time, on <a href='/blog/2012/11/16/integrating-snowplow-with-google-tag-manager/'>this blog post</a>.)</p>

<p>Since then, we&#8217;ve recommended that <strong>all</strong> new Snowplow users setup a tag management system, prior to integrating Snowplow on their website, if they have not already done so. The benefits of doing so are well documented elsewhere. For Snowplow users, there are two big benefits in particular, that we will flag:</p>

<ol>
<li>Going through the exercise of implementing a tag management solution forces companies to take a rigorous look at the data they pass from their website into the tag manager, especially when declaring the data explicitly using things like the <code>dataLayer</code> (in GTM) or the <code>Universal Variable</code> in OpenTag. This makes it easier for analysts, down the line, to understand <em>what</em> data has been passed into their web analytics system, and how that data has been generated: key bits of information that can often get lost months after web analytics platforms like Snowplow have been implemented. In addition, it makes the analytics as a whole more robust, as the generation of data is decoupled from the generation of other elements of web pages, which means web developers can continue to improve site functionality, safe in the knowledge they wont break anything on the analytics side.</li>

<li>A selfish reason, perhaps, but having our customers use a tag management platforms gives us the freedom to improve Snowplow tracking tags where we see the opportunity, safe in the knowledge that we&#8217;re not causing our clients too much difficulty to upgrade their tags.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt='qubit-opentag-logo' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/qubit-opentag.png' /></p>

<p>We were eager, having integrated Snowplow with GTM, to integrate it with an open source tag management system. After all, a big selling point of Snowplow is that it is open source: enabling companies to setup, own and manage their own data infrastructure, without relying on a third party to mediate their access to their own data. We were therefore delighted that QuBit has developed an open source tag management system, <a href='http://www.opentag.qubitproducts.com/'>OpenTag</a>, and that we have finally documented <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>how to integrate it with Snowplow</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot we like about QuBit&#8217;s OpenTag:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open source</strong>. You can view the <a href='https://github.com/QubitProducts/OpenTag/blob/master/OpenTag.js'>OpenTag.js</a> on Github to get a handle on exactly how OpenTag works</li>

<li><strong>Low cost hosted service</strong>. QuBit offers free hosting for sites with less than 1M page views per month, and $99 per 10M page views thereafter</li>

<li><strong>Easy-to-implement host-yourself option</strong>. You can use OpenTag&#8217;s web UI to configure all your tags for free and publish the results to a Javascript file that you can then host on your own CDN (e.g. Amazon Cloudfront). By not using Qubit to host the configured javascript file with all your different tags, you are not locked into QuBit as a vendor. In addition, the cost of managing your tags across large sites, content networks and ad networks is kept at a bare minimum.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to make it easier for new Snowplow users to implement OpenTag alongside Snowplow, and existing OpenTag users to implement Snowplow, we&#8217;ve documented how to setup Snowplow in OpenTag on our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Integrating%20Javascript%20tags%20with%20QuBit%20OpenTag'>setup guide</a>.</p>

<p>Keep plowing!</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/16/scala-maxmind-geoip-released">Scala MaxMind GeoIP library released</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>A short blog post this, to announce the release of <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'><strong>Scala MaxMind GeoIP</strong></a>, our Scala wrapper for the MaxMind <a href='http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/java/'>Java Geo-IP</a> library.</p>

<p>We have extracted Scala MaxMind GeoIP from our current (ongoing) work porting our ETL process from Apache Hive to <a href='https://github.com/twitter/scalding'>Scalding</a>. We extracted this as a separate library for two main reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Being good open-source citizens</strong> - as with our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser'>referer-parser</a> library, we believe this library willl be useful to the wider community of software developers, not just Snowplow users</li>

<li><strong>Keeping Snowplow&#8217;s footprint small</strong> - at Snowplow we believe very strongly in building modular, loosely-coupled software. Massive monolithic systems that &#8216;do everything&#8217; are a nightmare to test, maintain and extend - so we prefer to build small, standalone components and libraries which we (and the community) can then compose into larger pipelines and processes</li>
</ol>

<p>On to the library: for Scala developers, the main benefits of using <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/scala-maxmind-geoip'>scala-maxmind-geoip</a> over the MaxMind Java library are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to setup/test</strong> - the SBT project definition automatically pulls down the latest MaxMind Java code and <code>GeoLiteCity.dat</code></li>

<li><strong>Better type safety</strong> - the MaxMind Java library is somewhat null-happy. This library uses Option boxing wherever possible</li>

<li><strong>Better performance</strong> - as well as or instead of using MaxMind&#8217;s own caching (<code>GEOIP_MEMORY_CACHE</code>), you can also configure an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache of variable size</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#8217;s it! And if you have any problems with this Scala library for MaxMind GeoIP lookups, please <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/issues'>raise an issue</a> or get in touch with us via <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/Talk-to-us'>the usual channels</a>.</p>
