			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="" rel="author"> </a></span>
			<p>In the last couple of weeks, we have been experimenting with <a href='http://chartio.com/'>ChartIO</a> - a hosted BI tool for visualising data and creating dashboards. So far, we are very impressed - ChartIO is an excellent analytics tool to use to interrogate and visualise Snowplow data. Given the number of requests we get from Snowplow users to recommend tools to assist with analytics on Snowplow data, we thought it well worth sharing why ChartIO is so good, and give some examples of analyses on Snowplow data using ChartIO.</p>

<p><img alt='chartio-pic-0' src='/static/img/blog/2013/01/chartio-0.png' /></p>

<p>In this post we cover:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data#why'>Why is ChartIO so good?</a></li>

<li><a href='/blog/2013/01/08/using-chartio-to-visualise-and-interrogate-snowplow-data#engagement'>Tutorial: using ChartIO to unpick the drivers of engagement with a site</a></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name='why'>Why is ChartIO so good?</a></h2>
<p>ChartIO is great for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>. ChartIO is quick to setup. (Because it is a hosted product, with a very nice script for establishing an SSH connection between your database and the ChartIO web application.) At the same time, it is very quick, once a data connection is established, to create new graphs and charts and embed them in dashboards.</li>

<li><strong>Easy</strong>. ChartIO is easy to use. This is partly because the UI is really nice. (Lots of drag and drop, easy-to-follow workflow.) But it is also because ChartIO is very simple: it lacks a lot of the complexity of more traditional BI tools like Microstrategy and Pentaho. It is a lot simpler even than more recent innovations in the space like Tableau. Whilst this means it is a bit less powerful, the upside is the tool is a lot easier to use than comparable tools.</li>
</ol>

<p>ChartIO has one enormous advantage that makes it especially well suited to querying Snowplow data: it does not require the data to be in a specific format before it will let users chart / graph it. That compares with the vast majority of tools (including Tableau, Qlikview, Pentaho and Microstrategy) that all require that any data is structured in a format suitable for <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/converting-snowplow-data-into-a-format-suitable-for-olap.html'>OLAP analysis</a> before they can be used. (We covered how to convert Snowplow data into that format in the <a href='/analytics/tools-and-techniques/converting-snowplow-data-into-a-format-suitable-for-olap.html'>analytics cookbook</a>.) ChartIO <strong>does</strong> work better with data that is formatted in this way, but it still works beautifully with the data as is. As a result, <strong>ChartIO is, we believe, the easiest way to build graphs and dashboards on top of Snowplow data</strong>.</p>

			<p>Last week we released <a href='/blog/2013/01/03/snowplow-0.7.0-released/'>Snowplow 0.7.0</a>: which included a new Clojure Collector, with some significant new functionality for content networks and ad networks in particular. In this post we explain a lot of the thinking behind the Clojure Collector architecture, before taking a look ahead at the short and long-term development roadmap for the collector.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts we write where describe in some detail the thinking behind the architecture and design of Snowplow components, and discuss how we plan to develop those components over time. The purpose of doing so is to engage people like yourself: developers and analysts in the Snowplow community, in a discussion about how best to evolve Snowplow. The reasoning is simple: we have had many fantastic ideas and contributions from community members that have proved invaluable in driving Snowplow development, and we want to encourage more of these conversations and contributions, to help make Snowplow great.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/03/snowplow-0.7.0-released">Snowplow 0.7.0 released, with new Clojure-based collector</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>Today we are hugely excited to announce the release of Snowplow version <strong>0.7.0</strong>, which includes an experimental new <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master/2-collectors/clojure-collector'>Clojure-based collector</a> designed to run on <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/'>Amazon Elastic Beanstalk</a>. This release allows you to use Snowplow to uniquely identify and track users across multiple domains - even across a whole content or advertising network.</p>

<p>Many thanks to community member <a href='https://github.com/shermozle'>Simon Rumble</a> for developing many of the ideas underpinning the new collector in <a href='https://github.com/shermozle/SnowCannon'>SnowCannon</a>, his node.js-based collector for Snowplow.</p>

<p>To date, the primary collector for Snowplow events has been our CloudFront-based collector. The CloudFront-based collector has been easy to setup and very reliable, but has one main drawback: it does not support user tracking across multiple domains.</p>

<p>The Clojure-based collector changes this: it sets a unique user ID server-side and returns it to the browser as a third-party cookie; this user ID is then stored with your Snowplow events, instead of the first-party cookie set by the JavaScript tracker. This means that user=123 on, say, <a href='http://maven.snplow.com'>maven.snplow.com</a> will be the same as user=123 on <a href='http://snowplowanalytics.com'>snowplowanalytics.com</a>.</p>

<p>And the other good news is that our Clojure collector automatically logs the raw Snowplow events to Amazon S3 - and it logs in the exact same format as the CloudFront-based collector, so we can use the same ETL process for both collectors!</p>

<p>Read on below the fold for installation instructions and some additional information on this release.</p>

			<h1><a href="/blog/2013/01/02/referer-parser-ported-to-3-more-languages">referer-parser now with Java, Scala and Python support</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>Happy New Year all! It&#8217;s been three months since we <a href='/blog/2012/10/11/attlib-0.0.1-released/'>introduced our Attlib project</a>, now renamed to <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser'>referer-parser</a>, and we are pleased to announce that referer-parser is now available in three additional languages: Java, Scala and Python.</p>

<p>To recap: referer-parser is a simple library for extracting seach marketing attribution data from referer <em>(sic)</em> URLs. You supply referer-parser with a referer URL; it then tells you whether the URL is from a search engine - and if so, which search engine it is, and what keywords the user supplied to arrive at your page.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <a href='https://github.com/donspaulding'>Don Spaulding</a> @ <a href='http://mirusresearch.com/'>Mirus Research</a> for contributing the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser/tree/master/python'>Python port</a> of referer-parser; the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser/tree/master/java-scala'>Java/Scala port</a> was developed by us in-house and it will be a key addition to our <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/etl'>Snowplow ETL</a> process in the coming months.</p>

<p>You can checkout the code on GitHub, in the <a href='https://github.com/snowplow/referer-parser'>referer-parser repository</a>, or read on below the fold for some code examples in the new languages:</p>

			26 Dec 2012
			<h1><a href="/blog/2012/12/26/snowplow-0.6.5-released">Snowplow 0.6.5 released, with improved event tracking</a></h1>
			 <span class="author">Author: <a href="/alex.html" rel="author">Alex Dean </a></span>
			<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce our next Snowplow release - version <strong>0.6.5</strong>, a Boxing Day release for Snowplow!</p>

<p>This is a big release for us, as it introduces the idea of <strong>event types</strong> - every event sent by the JavaScript tracker to the collector now has an <code>event</code> field which specifies what type of event it is. This should be really helpful for a couple of things:</p>

<ol>
<li>It should make querying Snowplow events much easier</li>

<li>It should make Snowplow event data a better fit for JSON-oriented datastores such as MongoDB and Riak</li>
</ol>

<p>As well as event types, in this release we are also introducing <strong>event IDs</strong>. With this, the ETL phase adds an <code>event_id</code> UUID (universally unique ID) to each event row, which should help with subsequent querying.</p>

<p>Here is a taster of how Snowplow event data looks with the new event types and event IDs:</p>

<p><img alt='events-screenshot' src='/static/img/blog/2012/event_and_event_id_fields.png' /></p>

<p>These are not the only improvements in this version - here are the rest:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have cleaned up the code for on-page activity tracking (&#8220;page pings&#8221;)</li>

<li>We have fixed a bug that affected ad impression tracking - thanks <a href='https://github.com/talkspoon'>Alan Z</a>!</li>

<li>The ETL no longer dies if a raw event has a corrupted querystring (e.g. the <code>&amp;refr=</code> parameter was not escaped)</li>

<li>The JavaScript tracker&#8217;s build script, <code>snowpak.sh</code>, now has a combine-only option (no minification), which is helpful for testing purposes</li>

<li>The JavaScript tracker has a new method, <code>attachUserId(boolean)</code>, which can be used to stop the tracker sending a <code>&amp;uid=xxx</code> parameter</li>

<li>We have added the ability to override the IP address by passing in an <code>&amp;ip=</code> parameter on the querystring</li>
</ul>

<p>Below, we first explain how to upgrade, before taking a brief tour through these updates:</p>
