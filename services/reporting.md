# Report design and implementation

We deliver actionable, easy-to-understand KPI that enable your team to make the decisions they need to reach their specific goals.

<a name="context" />
## Context

When properly designed and delivered, a small set of KPI can enable a team to:

1. Quickly check their progress against plan
2. Spot any issues that emerge early
3. Recommend particular solutions to those issues

KPI are therefore enormously valuable. Unfortunately, KPI, especially KPI based on web analytics data, rarely fulfils the above functions:

1. Teams typically get 'swamped' in web analytics data, making it difficult to see the wood from the trees
2. KPI are not specifically identified around a team's particular goals, or take into account the broader company / product in which they function. As a result, KPI for things like 'user engagement' typically involve rough proxies (e.g. average page views per visit) that do not capture what 'successful engagement' looks like for a particular product / team / company
3. KPI are typically not designed with the levers that a team can pull in mind. As a result, they are not *actionable*: people look at them and think "that's interesting", but the numbers they look at don't lead them to make quick decisions that have a meaningful impact

<a name="approach" />
## Our approach

1. We work with our clients to understand (i) their goals, (ii) the key success factors for achieving those goals and (iii) the levers at their disposal for reaching those goals
2. We look at the complete set of data available to measure progress against those goals, and analyse: (i) what has happened to date, (ii) how relevant different data points are, and (iii) how sensitive to key success factors
3. On the basis of the above we design and mockup an easy to read KPI dashboard, and iterate this with the client. (This may or may not include SnowPlow data, as appropriate.)
4. When the client is happy with the dashboard we implement it technically.

<a name="output" />
## Output

The output of the project is either a working set of reports, delivered on a timely basis, or a complete specification for the client's development team to deliver those reports.


<a name="prices" />
## Prices

Reporting design and implementation projects generally involve two phases:

1. An analysis phase (corresponding to steps 1-3 above)
2. An implementation phase

We generally estimate the complete project cost and do the first part on a fixed fee basis, after which we give a fixed fee quote for the 2nd part.

The fixed fees we quote will be based on our [rate card] [rate-card].
